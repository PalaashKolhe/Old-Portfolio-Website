        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
            Hi! My name is Palaash and I come from Edmonton, Alberta. I'm currently in the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo and plan to graduate by 2025.
        </p>
        
        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
            I chose to pursue Software Engineering as a career because of my attraction towards developing code. Particularly code that is aimed to create solutions that can help better society. 
        </p>

        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
            My goal during this academic journey is to create innovative products that can help in the progression of society. I hope to do this with the bright and amazing people that I will come across in my time at the University or outside.            
        </p>
